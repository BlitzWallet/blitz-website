          This Privacy Policy explains how Blitz Wallet handles data in both the
          Blitz Wallet mobile application ("App") and the Blitz Wallet website
          ("Website"). These may differ in scope, and each section below makes
          clear whether it applies to the App, the Website, or both.

          Blitz Wallet LLC is the data controller responsible for personal

      <div class="contentSection">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          When you use the App or visit the Website, certain information is
          collected automatically:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb_p">
          <li>
            <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics collects a
            Firebase installation ID (a persistent device identifier), device
            model, operating system version, and app version. You may disable
            Crashlytics at any time in the App settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Website Analytics:</strong> The Blitz Wallet website uses
            Google Analytics to understand traffic sources and user
            demographics. Google Analytics may collect your IP address, device
            type, browser type, operating system, and behavioral session data.
            IP anonymization is enabled. You may opt out of Google Analytics
            tracking by installing the
            <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"
              >Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a

            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Website Cookies:</strong> The Website uses first-party
            analytics cookies set by Google Analytics (such as
            <code>_ga</code> and <code>_gid</code>) to measure website traffic.
            No other cookies are used on the Website. The App itself does not
            use cookies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information You Store in the App</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          The following types of information may be stored in the Blitz Wallet
          database. Not all items are required. We indicate which are optional
          and which are necessary for core functionality.
        </p>
        <ul class="mb_p">
          <li>
            <strong>Blitz Store Information (automatic):</strong> Purchases such
            as gift cards, messaging services, VPNs, or generative AI credits.
            All data is encrypted with your private key. For generative AI, you
            may choose whether to save a chat. All other purchases are
            automatically stored. You may delete gift cards, VPNs, and messages
            from the database at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Contacts (automatic for saved contacts; optional for
              profile):</strong
            >
            Saved contacts are encrypted with your private key and cannot be
            viewed by others. Your public contact profile includes your bio,
            name, Spark address, Spark identity public key, unique username, and
            UUID. The name and bio are customizable; other fields are
            automatically stored to enable LNURL addresses and contact lookups.
            <strong
              >Your profile is publicly visible to other Blitz users.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contact Profile Image (optional):</strong> Users may
            optionally store a profile image with Blitz. If provided, the image
            is saved in our database and is publicly visible as part of your
            profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>NIP-05 / Nostr (optional):</strong> A username and public
            key associated with your NIP-05 (Nostr) address. Adding this is
            completely optional. Once added, this association is propagated
            across a decentralized network of Nostr relays that Blitz does not
            operate or control, and cannot instruct to delete data. This
            association may persist permanently across the Nostr network.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Point-of-Sale (partial automatic):</strong> Your item list,
            receiving address, store currency, and store name. Items are
            optional; store currency defaults to USD; store name is
            automatically generated on first load. You may customize at any
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Push Notifications (optional):</strong> Notification
            settings and your push notification token. The push token is
            encrypted with the notification service's key, so only your device
            and the Blitz backend can access it. The push token does not contain
            personal information and cannot be used to identify you. Push
            notifications are optional and can be disabled at any time in your
            device settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Crash Reporting (automatic, opt-out available):</strong> We
            use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor App stability. Crashlytics
            collects non-personal device information (device model, OS version,
            app version, and a Firebase installation ID). This data is used only
            for debugging and App improvement and is retained for 90 days. You
            can disable Crashlytics at any time in the App settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paymeent Pools:</strong> Any payment pool created will be
            stored in Blitz's database. This included closedAt, contributor
            count, created at, creator name, creator UUID, current pool amount,
            pool derive index, pool goal amount, pools identity pubkey, last
            contribution, pool denomination(fiat), pool id, pool title, pool
            spark address, pool status, and transferTxId.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blitz Gifts:</strong> Any gifts you create are stored in
            Blitz's database. This includes the gift amount, created by, created
            time, denomination, description, amount, expiry time, gift number,
            gift identity pubkey, last updated, sat display, sttae, and gift
            uuid.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Temporarily Stored Information</h3>
        <ul class="mb_p">
          <li>
            <strong>Blitz Contact Payments:</strong> Payment actions (sending,
            requesting, accepting, or declining payments) are temporarily stored
            on Blitz servers, encrypted using a shared key between the involved
            users. Only the parties involved can decrypt this information. All
            contact payment data is automatically deleted after
            <strong>7 days</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Point-of-Sale Payments:</strong> Sales made through the
            Point-of-Sale feature are temporarily stored to sync payment details
            when the admin wallet comes back online. Data is encrypted and
            accessible only by the admin. Automatically deleted after
            <strong>30 days</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>LNURL Payments:</strong> LNURL payments are temporarily
            stored until you open the App, at which point the payment data is
            deleted from the database and saved locally on your device. This
            temporary storage is necessary to include payment descriptions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Blockchain and On-Chain Data</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          Because Blitz Wallet is self-custodial and built on public blockchain
          networks, your wallet addresses and transactions are
          <strong>permanently and publicly recorded</strong> on the Bitcoin
          blockchain, the Spark Network, and other networks you use. This data
          is immutable — it cannot be deleted or modified by Blitz Wallet or
          anyone else, including in response to deletion requests under
          applicable privacy law (see Section 8).
        </p>
        <p>
          Public blockchain data may be analyzed by third-party blockchain
          analytics firms (such as Chainalysis, Elliptic, and others) to
          associate addresses with real-world identities through transaction
          pattern analysis. Bitcoin's UTXO model means that spending from
          multiple addresses in a single transaction can link those addresses
          together in analytics tools. You should assume that any on-chain
          transaction is permanently and publicly associated with the wallet
          address from which it was sent or received.

      <!-- ─── 7. SELF-CUSTODIAL WALLET & BLOCKCHAIN PRIVACY ─────────── -->
      <div class="contentSection">
        <h2>7. Self-Custodial Wallet and Blockchain Privacy</h2>

        <h3>Self-Custodial Architecture</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          Blitz Wallet is self-custodial, meaning only you have access to your
          funds. When creating a wallet, you receive a 12-word seed phrase
          stored on the iOS Keychain or Android Keystore. Blitz Wallet
          <strong>never</strong> transmits your seed phrase, private keys, or
          wallet backup to Blitz servers. You are solely responsible for
          securing and backing up your seed phrase offline.
        </p>
        <p class="mb_p">
          Because your seed phrase is stored on a device connected to the
          internet, Blitz is considered a <strong>hot wallet</strong> and cannot
          be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h3>On-Chain Data Is Permanent and Public</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          Transactions made through the Bitcoin, or Spark networks are
          permanently and publicly recorded on their respective blockchains.
          This means:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb_p">
          <li>
            <strong>Immutability:</strong> On-chain transaction data cannot be
            deleted, modified, or removed by Blitz Wallet or anyone else — ever.
            This is a technical limitation that applies even in response to
            legally valid deletion requests under GDPR or CCPA. See Section 8
            for how this affects your privacy rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transaction Graph Analysis:</strong> Public blockchain data
            can be analyzed by third-party blockchain analytics firms to
            associate wallet addresses with real-world identities through
            transaction pattern analysis, spending behavior, and counterparty
            relationships.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>UTXO Linkage:</strong> Bitcoin's UTXO model means that
            spending from multiple addresses in a single transaction can link
            those addresses together in analytics tools, reducing effective
            privacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spark Network:</strong> Spark is a coordinated network
            operated by Spark operators. Spark operators may have visibility
            into routing information and transaction metadata as part of
            operating the coordinator service. Spark transactions should not be
            assumed to be fully private.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- ─── 8. SECURITY ────────────────────────────────────────────── -->
      <div class="contentSection">
        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p class="mb_p">
          We implement industry-standard security measures to protect data
          stored on our servers, including encryption of user data with
          user-controlled private keys where applicable.
        </p>
        <p class="mb_p">
          No security system is completely immune to compromise. In the event of
          a data security incident affecting personal information stored on our
          servers, Blitz Wallet will:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb_p">
          <li>
            Notify affected users in accordance with applicable law (including
            Michigan's Data Breach Notification Act, EU/UK GDPR Arts. 33-34, and
            applicable state breach notification statutes)
          </li>
          <li>
            Report to applicable supervisory authorities within required
            timeframes (72 hours for GDPR-covered incidents)
          </li>
          <li>Take prompt steps to contain and remediate the incident</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that security incidents affecting Blitz servers do not affect
          your self-custodial funds — your seed phrase and private keys are
          never transmitted to or stored on our servers.
        </p>

      <!-- ─── 9. APPLICATION PERMISSIONS ────────────────────────────── -->
      <div class="contentSection">

          WireGuard. Files are stored locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          To provide a seamless Lightning Network experience, you may receive
          push notifications when the App is in the background or closed. Blitz
          uses Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) and Google Firebase Cloud
          Messaging (FCM) for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enable notifications, Blitz Wallet stores a unique push
          notification token in our database. This token is linked to your
          device only and is used solely for delivering notifications. It does
          not contain personal information and cannot be used to identify you.
          You may disable notifications at any time in your device settings or
          within the App.
