        <p>
          Blitz Wallet, LLC created the Blitz app as a free app. The service for
          the app is provided by Blitz Wallet, LLC at no cost and is intended
          for use as is. This Privacy Policy explains how Blitz Wallet handles
          data in both the Blitz Wallet mobile application (“App”) and the Blitz
          Wallet website (“Website”). These may differ in scope, and each
          section below makes clear whether it applies to the App, the Website,
          or both.

      <div class="contentSection">
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p class="mb_p">
          The Blitz Wallet App integrates with third-party services to provide
          features such as swaps, payments, user profiles, or liquidity
          functions. These services may collect or process personal information
          as described in their own privacy notices. However, the Blitz Wallet
          website uses Google Analytics to understand traffic sources and user
          demographics to better position the website to reach as many people as
          possible.

          Below is a list of the types of information that may be stored in the
          Blitz Wallet database. Not all items are required. We will indicate
          which items are optional and which are necessary for core
          functionality.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Blitz Store Information:</strong> This includes purchases
            such as gift cards, messaging services, VPNs, or generative AI. All
            data is encrypted with your private key. For generative AI, you can
            choose whether to save a chat or not. All other purchases are
            automatically stored. You may delete gift cards, VPNs, and messages
            from the database at any time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Contacts:</strong> This includes both your saved contacts
            and your contact profile. Any added contacts are encrypted with your
            private key and cannot be viewed by others. Your profile, however,
            is public. Profile data includes your bio, name, Spark address,
            Spark identity public key, unique username, and UUID. The name and
            bio are customizable, while the other fields are automatically
            stored to enable LNURL addresses and contact lookups.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Contact Profile Image:</strong> Users may optionally store a
            profile image with Blitz. If provided, the image is saved in our
            database.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>NIP-05:</strong> This includes a username and public key
            associated with your NIP-05 (Nostr) address. Adding this is
            completely optional.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Point-of-Sale:</strong> This includes your item list,
            receiving address, store currency, and store name. Items are
            optional, the store currency defaults to USD, and the store name is
            automatically generated when you first load the app. You may
            customize the name, currency, and items at any time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Push Notifications:</strong> This includes notification
            settings and your push token. The push token is encrypted with the
            notification service’s key, so only your device and the backend can
            access it. Push notifications are optional and can be disabled at
            any time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to
            monitor app stability and improve reliability. Crashlytics may
            collect non-personal device information (such as device model,
            operating system version, and app usage patterns). This data is used
            only for debugging and app improvement. You can disable Crashlytics
            at any time in the app settings.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="contentSection">
        <h2>Other Stored Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Blitz Contact Payments:</strong> To facilitate payments
            between Blitz users, payment actions (such as sending, requesting,
            accepting, or declining payments) are temporarily stored on Blitz
            servers. Payment contents are encrypted using a shared key between
            the users, ensuring that only the parties involved can decrypt the
            information. All contact payment data is automatically deleted after
            7 days.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Point-of-Sale Payments:</strong> Sales made through the
            Point-of-Sale feature are temporarily stored so that when the admin
            wallet comes back online, payment details can be synced with the
            user. All Point-of-Sale data is encrypted and can only be accessed
            by the admin. Data is automatically deleted after 7 days.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>LNURL Payments:</strong> LNURL payments are temporarily
            stored until the user opens Blitz, at which point the payment data
            is deleted from the database and saved locally on the user’s device.
            This temporary storage is necessary to include payment descriptions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="contentSection">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          Blitz Wallet is self-custodial, meaning that only you have access to
          your funds. When creating an account, you will receive a 12-word seed
          phrase stored on the iOS Keychain or Android Keystore, depending on
          your operating system. Because your seed phrase is stored online,
          Blitz is considered a hot wallet and cannot be guaranteed to be 100%
          secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blitz Wallet never transmits your seed phrase, private keys, or wallet
          backup to Blitz servers. You are solely responsible for securing and
          backing up your seed phrase offline. Transactions made through the
          Bitcoin, or Spark networks are inherently public, meaning wallet
          addresses and transaction details may be visible on their respective
          blockchains.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="contentSection">
        <h2>Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
        <p class="mb_p">
          Blitz Wallet links to multiple third-party websites. When you click on
          a link, you will be redirected to their page. Blitz Wallet does not
          control these websites. It is recommended that you read their Privacy
          Policies. Blitz Wallet assumes no responsibility for the content or
          practices of these third-party sites.
        </p>
        <p class="mb_p">
          The Blitz Wallet App uses the following third-party services:

          <li>
            Spark – required for sending and receiving Lightning payments.
            Because payments are coordinated through Spark, your transactions
            should not be considered private. Spark may have access to certain
            transaction data as part of providing this service. If Spark's
            services are unavailable, users may need to perform a unilateral
            exit to recover funds. You can learn more here:

            Flashnet – reqiured for handling swaps between Bitcoin and USDB.
            Flashnet may collect certain transaction and usage data in
            connection with swaps executed through our App. This may include
            blockchain transaction metadata, wallet identifiers, and usage
            analytics. Please review Flashnet’s Privacy Notice for details on

        <h3>Camera Access</h3>
        <p class="permission_p">
          Blitz requires access to your camera to scan Lightning payment
          requests, and Blitz contact details.
        </p>
        <h3>Network Access</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">This is necessary for:</p>

          <li>Connection to the Breez SDK</li>
          <li>Connection to Boltz API</li>
          <li>Connection to Spark</li>

          To save any purchased VPN configuration files for easy upload into
          WireGuard.
        </p>
        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p>
          To provide a seamless experience with the Lightning Network, you may
          occasionally receive push notifications. For example, if your app is
          in the background or closed. Blitz uses Apple Push Notifications and
          the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging service to fulfill this
          functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enable notifications, Blitz Wallet stores a unique push
          notification token in our database. This token is linked to your
          device only and is used solely for delivering notifications. It does
          not contain personal information and cannot be used to identify you.
          You may disable notifications at any time in your device settings.

          This Supplemental Notice applies to personal information that you
          voluntarily provide in connection with your use of Blitz Wallet,
          including, but not limited to, your name, username, profile image, and
          bio. No personal information is required to use the core functionality
          of the App, and you are free to use the Services without providing any
          optional personal information. By choosing to provide personal
          information, you consent to the processing of that information as
          described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Lawful Bases for Processing</h2>
        <p class="mb_p">
          The processing of optional personal information is supported by one or

        <ul>
          <li>
            Consent - You voluntarily provide personal information, and
            processing is based on your explicit consent. You may withdraw your
            consent at any time; withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
            processing carried out prior to such withdrawal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Legitimate Interests - Processing may also be necessary for our
            legitimate interests, such as maintaining user profiles or
            displaying usernames or profile images provided such interests are
            not overridden by your rights and freedoms.
