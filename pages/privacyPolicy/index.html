          <h2>Blitz</h2>
          <p>
            Blitz Wallet, LLC created the Blitz app as a free app. The service
            for the app is provided by Blitz Wallet, LLC at no cost and is
            intended for use as is. This Privacy Policy explains how Blitz
            Wallet handles data in both the Blitz Wallet mobile application
            (“App”) and the Blitz Wallet website (“Website”). These may differ
            in scope, and each section below makes clear whether it applies to
            the App, the Website, or both.

          <h2>Information Collection</h2>
          <p class="mb_p">
            The Blitz Wallet app does not use any third-party services to
            collect personal information. However, the Blitz Wallet website uses
            Google Analytics to understand traffic sources and user demographics
            to better position the website to reach as many people as possible.

            Below is a list of the types of information that may be stored in
            the Blitz Wallet database. Not all items are required. We will
            indicate which items are optional and which are necessary for core
            functionality.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Blitz Store Information:</strong> This includes purchases
              such as gift cards, messaging services, VPNs, or generative AI.
              All data is encrypted with your private key. For generative AI,
              you can choose whether to save a chat or not. All other purchases
              are automatically stored. You may delete gift cards, VPNs, and
              messages from the database at any time.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Contacts:</strong> This includes both your saved contacts
              and your contact profile. Any added contacts are encrypted with
              your private key and cannot be viewed by others. Your profile,
              however, is public. Profile data includes your bio, name, Spark
              address, Spark identity public key, unique username, and UUID. The
              name and bio are customizable, while the other fields are
              automatically stored to enable LNURL addresses and contact
              lookups.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Contact Profile Image:</strong> Users may optionally store
              a profile image with Blitz. If provided, the image is saved in our
              database.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>NIP-05:</strong> This includes a username and public key
              associated with your NIP-05 (Nostr) address. Adding this is
              completely optional.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Point-of-Sale:</strong> This includes your item list,
              receiving address, store currency, and store name. Items are
              optional, the store currency defaults to USD, and the store name
              is automatically generated when you first load the app. You may
              customize the name, currency, and items at any time.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Push Notifications:</strong> This includes notification
              settings and your push token. The push token is encrypted with the
              notification service’s key, so only your device and the backend
              can access it. Push notifications are optional and can be disabled
              at any time.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to
              monitor app stability and improve reliability. Crashlytics may
              collect non-personal device information (such as device model,
              operating system version, and app usage patterns). This data is
              used only for debugging and app improvement. You can disable
              Crashlytics at any time in the app settings.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Other Stored Information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Blitz Contact Payments:</strong> To facilitate payments
              between Blitz users, payment actions (such as sending, requesting,
              accepting, or declining payments) are temporarily stored on Blitz
              servers. Payment contents are encrypted using a shared key between
              the users, ensuring that only the parties involved can decrypt the
              information. All contact payment data is automatically deleted
              after 7 days.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Point-of-Sale Payments:</strong> Sales made through the
              Point-of-Sale feature are temporarily stored so that when the
              admin wallet comes back online, payment details can be synced with
              the user. All Point-of-Sale data is encrypted and can only be
              accessed by the admin. Data is automatically deleted after 7 days.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>LNURL Payments:</strong> LNURL payments are temporarily
              stored until the user opens Blitz, at which point the payment data
              is deleted from the database and saved locally on the user’s
              device. This temporary storage is necessary to include payment
              descriptions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            Blitz Wallet is self-custodial, meaning that only you have access to
            your funds. When creating an account, you will receive a 12-word
            seed phrase stored on the iOS Keychain or Android Keystore,
            depending on your operating system. Because your seed phrase is
            stored online, Blitz is considered a hot wallet and cannot be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blitz Wallet never transmits your seed phrase, private keys, or
            wallet backup to Blitz servers. You are solely responsible for
            securing and backing up your seed phrase offline. Transactions made
            through the Bitcoin, or Spark networks are inherently public,
            meaning wallet addresses and transaction details may be visible on
            their respective blockchains.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
          <p class="mb_p">
            Blitz Wallet links to multiple third-party websites. When you click
            on a link, you will be redirected to their page. Blitz Wallet does
            not control these websites. It is recommended that you read their
            Privacy Policies. Blitz Wallet assumes no responsibility for the
            content or practices of these third-party sites.

            <li>
              Spark – required for sending and receiving Lightning payments.
              Because payments are coordinated through Spark, your transactions
              should not be considered private. Spark may have access to certain
              transaction data as part of providing this service. If Spark's
              services are unavailable, users may need to perform a unilateral
              exit to recover funds. You can learn more here:

          <h2>Application Permissions</h2>
          <h3>Camera Access</h3>
          <p class="permission_p">
            Blitz requires access to your camera to scan Lightning payment
            requests, and Blitz contact details.

          <h3>Notifications</h3>
          <p>
            To provide a seamless experience with the Lightning Network, you may
            occasionally receive push notifications. For example, if your app is
            in the background or closed. Blitz uses Apple Push Notifications and
            the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging service to fulfill this
            functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            To enable notifications, Blitz Wallet stores a unique push
            notification token in our database. This token is linked to your
            device only and is used solely for delivering notifications. It does
            not contain personal information and cannot be used to identify you.
            You may disable notifications at any time in your device settings.
