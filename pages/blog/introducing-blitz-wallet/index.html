        <p>
          Hello everybody. Today we are excited to talk about Blitz Wallet: a
          self-custodial Bitcoin-only wallet that integrates Lightning, Liquid,
          and eCash to deliver a seamless user experience tailored to individual
          needs. Most people in Bitcoin can agree that Bitcoin has
          revolutionized the way we think about money and financial
          independence. Yet, as important as that financial independence is, the
          usability gap remains a challenge new people trying to use Bitcoin in
          its original purpose: a currency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s dive deeper into how Blitz Wallet works and how it’s reshaping
          the way users interact with Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <h2>How Blitz Wallet Works</h2>
        <p>Blitz Wallet uses three Bitcoin technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lightning Network for non-permissionless cheap payments.</li>
          <li>
            Liquid Network for lightning channel liquidity management + offline
            payments + beginner nodeless lightning experience.
          </li>
          <li>eCash for small micropayments with no lightning channel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our wallet has tied together these three technologies to maximize user
          experience and minimizing technical expertise.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1: Onboarding</h3>
        <p>
          The most critical step in any Bitcoiners journey is when they send and
          receive their first Bitcoin payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a user first downloads Blitz Wallet, they can immediately start
          sending and receiving Bitcoin payments without the need to open a
          Lightning channel. This is because Blitz Wallet leverages Boltz Atomic
          Liquid swaps to seamlessly convert Bitcoin on-chain or lightning
          payments to Liquid BTC. This allows users to bypass the lightning
          network initial channel open fee which may not be economical based on
          the amount of the first transaction. The beauty in this beginning
          nodeless environment is the removal of complex lightning topics for
          new Bitcoiners.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there was a problem with this setup. Because Boltz has a
          minimum swap amount of 1000 sats or .00001000 Bitcoin, this excludes
          users from being able to take advantage of the Lightning networks
          micropayments feature. That is why we added an Experimental eCash
          feature, which provides the ability to send and receive micropayments
          for users while they do not have a Lightning channel open.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: The Custodial Ladder</h3>
        <p>
          Our philosophy at Blitz is user choice. Some users might want a less
          complex payment experience while others might want to maximize how
          permissionless there money is. As users grow more comfortable with
          using Bitcoin and their balances increase, Blitz Wallet introduces the
          “custodial ladder” to help them transition to full self-custody.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are a couple of main ways you can customize your payment
          experience in Blitz Wallet.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Toggling Lightning: By default, the use of Lighting is turned off.
            This is because, when off, the wallet is not dependent on the
            lighting node reducing the chance of connectivity issues. However,
            when a user learns more about Lightning, they can turn it on in
            settings at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Threshold-Based Channel Opening: Once a user’s balance reaches a
            preset threshold of 500,000 sats and Lightning is turned on, Blitz
            Wallet automatically attempts to open a Lightning channel. The user
            can configure this threshold as well as the maximum fee they’re
            willing to pay for opening a channel. If the fee conditions are met,
            the channel is opened, giving the user 100% self-custody of their
            funds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Liquidity Management: One of the biggest challenges with Lightning
            is managing liquidity. Blitz Wallet solves this by dynamically
            balancing funds when the rebalance amount is over a set threshold
            (default is 10,000 sats). For example:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If a user receives more Bitcoin than their inbound liquidity
              allows, Blitz Wallet automatically generates a Lightning-to-Liquid
              invoice to ensure payment completion.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a user spends funds from their Lightning channel, creating
              enough inbound capacity, Blitz Wallet swaps Liquid BTC back into
              the channel to maintain balance.
            </li>
            <li>
              A user can also manually perform swaps in settings if liquidity
              needs to be freed up for an incoming transaction.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By providing choice to the user, we can give various payment
          experiences all from a singular app. Say goodbye to onboarding your
          friend to a custodial solution only for them to need to download a new
          self-custodial app later. These features also ensure that less
          technical users can seamlessly send and receive payments without
          running into liquidity issues when using the lightning network.
        </p>
        <h2>Blitz Wallet Features</h2>
        <h3>Integrations Are King</h3>

        <p>
          One of the most common questions we hear from newcomers to Bitcoin is,
          “What can I actually do with it?” While there are plenty of online
          platforms where Bitcoin can be used, these platforms aren’t integrated
          directly into most wallets. Instead, wallets rely on webviews to link
          users to these platforms, which often disrupts the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this, we introduced a native store feature in Blitz Wallet.
          Instead of relying on webviews, we use APIs (Application Programming
          Interfaces) to seamlessly connect users to Bitcoin-accepting services
          directly within the app. This approach keeps the experience smooth and
          consistent without requiring users to leave the app. Currently, Blitz
          Wallet supports four key integrations.
        </p>

          class="conetentImage"
          src="./assets/storeImage.PNG"
          alt="Image of Biltz store page"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gift Cards: Through an in-app integration with The Bitcoin Company,
            users can buy gift cards to various stores. The number of gift cards
            available varies depending on the user’s location, enabling Bitcoin
            to be spent at local retailers.
          </li>
          <li>
            VPN Services: Privacy-conscious users can use their Bitcoin to
            purchase VPN, enhancing their online security.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generative AI Credits: Users can purchase credits for cutting-edge
            AI services, including Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-Mini, and
            Gemini-Flash-1.5. This opens up exciting possibilities for
            leveraging AI tools using Bitcoin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anonymous Text Messages: For those seeking privacy in communication,
            Blitz Wallet allows users to send anonymous text messages directly
            from the app.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This built-in utility ensures that Bitcoin becomes immediately useful
          for new users, showcasing the usability of Bitcoin as a currency.
        </p>
        <h3>Reaching Who Matters</h3>
        <p>
          One big challenge with using Bitcoin is how hard it is to pay friends
          easily. We like to call this the “QR code problem.” Right now, most
          Bitcoin transactions between people rely on QR codes—not because
          they’re convenient, but because manually typing out a Bitcoin address
          is nearly impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          While LNURL Pay was a step forward in solving this, most LNURL
          services are custodial. This is because receiving funds in a
          self-custodial way on mobile devices either requires the app to always
          be online or app wake up notifications, which can be unreliable.
        </p>
        <img
          class="conetentImage"
          src="./assets/chatMenu.PNG"
          alt="Image of Biltz store page"
        />
        <p>
          To address this, we created an internal contacts payment system that
          simplifies the process of paying a friend to just using their name.
          Inspired by Venmo’s simple and user-friendly design, this system
          removes all the technical details of Bitcoin transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure Blitz Wallet works seamlessly with other Lightning wallets,
          we also allow users to add LNURL Lightning addresses. This means you
          can pay other Lightning wallets just as easily as you would pay a
          Blitz contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blitz’s internal contacts system addresses key user experience
          challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generating Payment Addresses: Without Blitz, paying a friend who
            doesn’t already have an LNURL address requires them to manually
            generate an invoice for every transaction, which is inefficient and
            creates a poor user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Address Complexity: Bitcoin Lightning addresses are often long and
            intimidating for new users. Bitcoin and Liquid addresses can feel
            even more daunting, especially for those unfamiliar with the
            technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplifying Transactions: By managing contacts behind the scenes,
            Blitz ensures that users only see simple "Send" and "Request"
            buttons, eliminating the need to deal with intimidating payment
            addresses.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This streamlined approach makes transacting intuitive and stress-free,
          especially for newcomers. This decreases the payment barrier and
          allows more people to start paying each other in Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <h2>The Vision for the Future</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to make Bitcoin more accessible to everyone regardless
          of technical expertise. The benefits of Bitcoin come in its use, but
          that use can only happen when it becomes simple enough. So, whether
          you’re a beginner making your first Bitcoin transaction or an advanced
          user managing multiple channels, Blitz Wallet provides the tools you
          need to succeed.
