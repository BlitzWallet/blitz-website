          At Blitz Wallet, our mission is to provide a seamless and simple
          Bitcoin experience. We're excited to introduce our latest update,
          packed with enhancements that improve performance, expand
          functionality, and refine the user interface. Let's explore the key
          features and improvements in this release.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s dive into the details:</p>

        <h2>
          Optimized Transaction Sorting for Lightning, Liquid, and eCash
          Payments
        </h2>
        <p>
          Managing transactions across multiple networks—Lightning, Liquid, and
          eCash—requires efficient processing to maintain a smooth user
          experience. In this update, we've built upon our last update that uses
          a max-heap sorting method. Now, instead of restoring every time you
          reach the homepage + any updates outside of transactions we globalized
          the sorting method as to only re-render when transaction data changes.
          This significantly reduces the memory usage and improves transaction
          sorting speed. This optimization ensures that your transaction history
          loads faster and operates more smoothly, enhancing overall app
          performance.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Seamless Tipping with the Lightning Network (LNURL) or Blitz Contacts
        </h2>
        <p>
          We're thrilled to see the overwhelming response to our Blitz Wallet
          Point-of-Sale system! Based on your feedback, we're excited to
          announce our latest update, which builds on the success of our
          previous release.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Streamlined Tipping Process:</strong> Before, when loading
            the point-of-sale users were prompted to enter a generic name. Now,
            our updated point-of-sale system now prompts users to enter either
            an LNURL (Lightning Network URL) or a Blitz contact name, making it
            easier to send tips directly to the intended recipient.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Tip Tracking:</strong> When viewing point-of-sale
            transactions within Blitz, you'll now see tips grouped by LNURL or
            Blitz contact name, along with additional details, such as the date
            and time of the transaction, number of paid tips, number of unpaid
            tips, and total tip balance. You can also see individual tips and
            mark them as paid or unpaid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Simplified Payouts:</strong> Say goodbye to manual
            invoicing! With this update, you can now directly pay out tips to
            employees from within the app, eliminating the need for separate
            invoicing processes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Improved App Access with Lightning Node Failures</h2>
        <p>
          While self-custodial Lightning is the goal, connecting to a Lightning
          node involves more moving parts than connecting to a Liquid node.
          Previously, if the Lightning connection failed, you couldn’t load the
          Blitz Wallet app at all—resulting in a frustrating user experience.
          We’ve fixed that.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this update, if you have Lightning enabled and the app fails to
          connect to the Lightning node, you can still access the app. This
          ensures uninterrupted access to your wallet, even if there are
          connectivity issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> You still won’t be able to use Lightning until
          the connection is restored, but you can continue using the generative
          AI store features, as well as make payments with Liquid or eCash.
        </p>
        <h2>Customizable eCash Limits for Greater Control</h2>
        <p>
          We heard your feedback—everyone wants eCash! While we’re excited to
          offer a customizable payment experience that you can tailor to your
          needs, we also believe it’s crucial to incentivize self-custody.
          That’s why, while we’ve expanded the amounts you can hold and receive
          in eCash, we’ve also introduced limits to ensure that large balances
          aren't stored in a vulnerable place where funds could be stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, eCash payments were restricted to amounts below the
          minimum Boltz swap amount of 1,000 sats, and your maximum eCash
          balance was capped at 5,000 sats before it would be auto-swapped to
          Liquid. Now, you can customize both your maximum receive and maximum
          balance amounts for eCash. For example, if you set your max receive
          limit to 10,000 sats, any invoice above that will use Liquid.
          Similarly, if your max balance is 10,000 sats and your current balance
          is 5,000 sats, you can only receive an additional 5,000 sats. This
          customization gives you the flexibility to manage your eCash
          transactions according to your preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for these limits is based on a basic economic calculation.
          A Lightning payment of 10,000 sats incurs a fee of approximately 73
          sats (0.73%). While eCash transactions have a 0 sat fee, that small
          Lightning fee is the price you pay for the added benefits of
          self-custody.
        </p>
        <h2>Expanded Manual Swap Options Including eCash</h2>
        <p>
          Blitz Wallet allows you to hold funds across multiple networks, so
          it's essential to give you the flexibility to manage where those funds
          are stored. We already support internal swaps between Lightning and
          Liquid. Now, we've expanded that capability by adding eCash to the
          manual swap page. You can now seamlessly move funds between Liquid and
          eCash, eCash and Liquid, and even eCash and Lightning. This
          enhancement gives you greater flexibility and control over how and
          where you choose to store your funds.
        </p>

        <h2>Pay with eCash in the Blitz Store & to Contacts</h2>
        <p>
          We’ve expanded the utility of eCash by adding the ability to pay for
          items in the Blitz Store using your eCash balance. This integration
          enhances your shopping experience within the app, providing a
          convenient payment option. Additionally, with the increased balance
          limit for eCash, you can now pay Blitz contacts directly using eCash.
          This means that all three payment options—Lightning, Liquid, and
          eCash—are available for payments to Blitz contacts and within the
          store.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Enhancements:</h2>
        <h3>Delete Wallet Balance Fix</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure you have a complete view of your balance before deleting
          your wallet, we've added the eCash balance to the remove wallet
          feature. If eCash is enabled, your entire wallet balance, including
          eCash, will be displayed, providing a comprehensive overview of your
          funds.
        </p>
        <h3>Backend Enhancements for Improved Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          We've made significant backend improvements to optimize performance by
          switching from linear single requests during contact address changes
          to bulk requests, reducing network usage by tenfold. This change
          enhances efficiency and speeds up the update process.
        </p>
        <h3>User Interface and Style Improvements</h3>
        <p>
          A consistent and visually appealing interface enhances user
          experience. In this update, we've standardized the colors of settings
          items, ensuring a uniform look throughout the app. These style fixes
          contribute to a more polished and intuitive interface.
        </p>
        <h3>Real-Time Payment Updates for SMS</h3>
        <p>
          Staying informed about what is happening while making a payment is
          crucial. To enhance your store experience, and transparency, we have
          added real time updates during the send SMS process. This means that
          you will be show update messages for each step of the process ensuring
          you're always aware of what's happening in the background.
        </p>
        <h3>General Bug Fixes</h3>
        <p>
          This update includes several under-the-hood improvements to boost
          overall app stability and provide a more dependable user experience.
        </p>
