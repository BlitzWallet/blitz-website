        <div class="contentContainer">

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
              Blitz Wallet is a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet designed to
              simplify Bitcoin payments and solve key challenges in the Bitcoin
              space: Bitcoin is slow for payments, it’s unclear how to use, and
              it can feel too complex. By focusing on usability and simplicity,
              Blitz Wallet integrates the Bitcoin Lightning Network,
              <a
                href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001408623-How-does-Liquid-Bitcoin-L-BTC-work"
              >
                Liquid sidechain</a
              >, and <a href="https://cashu.space/">eCash</a> to balance their
              trade-offs and make self-custodial payments easier. The wallet
              addresses key barriers such as complex invoices, dinner paradox,
              and liquidity management. With features like a native contacts
              system, store to enable use of your Bitcoin, automated liquidity
              handling, and a gradual transition to self-custody, Blitz Wallet
              creates an intuitive experience for both beginners and experienced
              users. Our mission is to create the simplest, most user-friendly
              Bitcoin wallet. We envision a world where everyone has full
              control over their money and can transact freely and effortlessly
              with others.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="problem" class="sectionContainer">
            <h2>1. Problem</h2>
            <p>
              A major hurdle that Bitcoin has yet to overcome is usability for
              day-to-day payments. This issue is evident in what we call the QR
              code problem. Currently, the most common way to share Bitcoin
              addresses or Lightning invoices is through QR codes. This is for
              two major reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Finality of payments – Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, so
                manually entering an address increases the risk of errors and
                potential loss of funds
              </li>
              <li>
                Complexity of addresses – Bitcoin addresses and Lightning
                invoices are long and difficult to read, which can be
                intimidating for new users.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              While QR codes help mitigate these risks, they also create
              usability friction. Traditional payment networks use simple
              identifiers like usernames or phone numbers, making payments
              seamless. Bitcoin, in contrast, often feels like a step backward
              in user experience. While protocals such as LNURL, Bolt12, and
              silent payments are improvements, friction still occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another challenge is the complexity of the lightning network: a
              Layer 2 solutions designed to improve Bitcoin’s payment
              throughput. The Lightning network introduces technical quirks not
              seen in traditional payment networks, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Lightning Network channel capacity – Users can only receive
                payments if their channel has enough inbound liquidity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Invoice limitations – Lightning invoices expire and can only be
                used once.
              </li>
              <li>
                Node uptime – Lightning nodes must remain online to send and
                receive payments.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These constraints require users to understand the underlying
              protocol before they can effectively use Bitcoin, creating a
              significant barrier to adoption. Given these usability challenges,
              there is a clear need for a wallet that seamlessly integrates
              Bitcoin’s scaling technologies into a simple, intuitive
              experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="solution" class="sectionContainer">
            <h2>2. Solution</h2>
            <p>
              Blitz Wallet addresses Bitcoin's usability challenges by
              integrating multiple technologies—Lightning Network, Liquid
              Network, and eCash—to offer a seamless and user-friendly
              experience. Here's how Blitz Wallet tackles these issues:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Simplified Onboarding so new users can start sending and
                receiving Bitcoin payments immediately without the need to open
                a Lightning channel. By leveraging
                <a href="https://boltz.exchange/"> Boltz Atomic Liquid swaps</a
                >, Bitcoin on-chain or Lightning payments are automatically
                converted to Liquid BTC. This eliminates the complexity of
                channel management and reduces onboarding friction.<br />
                <br />
                While Boltz swaps have a minimum swap amount of 1,000 sats,
                Blitz Wallet also integrates eCash for micropayments, allowing
                users to send and receive small transactions without
                limitations. This ensures a smooth and flexible payment
                experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simple Payments Traditional payment apps like Venmo or Cash App
                succeed due to their simplicity in connecting users. Blitz
                Wallet embraces this by implementing a native contacts system,
                allowing users to add each other via usernames. This eliminates
                the need for exchanging invoices and greatly reduces friction in
                everyday transactions. <br /><br />
                By simplifying payments, Blitz Wallet resolves the "Dinner
                Paradox", where splitting bills in Bitcoin becomes cumbersome
                due to invoice-based transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Customizable Transition to Self-Custody Blitz Wallet introduces
                a "custodial ladder" to help users transition to full
                self-custody at their own pace:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Beginning: Users leverage Liquid atomic swaps to facilitate
                    payments and can optionally enable eCash for micropayments.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Middle: As users gain knowledge about Bitcoin and the
                    importance of self-custody, they begin swapping eCash for
                    Liquid.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    End: Users can enable Lightning Network support when ready,
                    with the wallet automatically opening a Lightning channel
                    when their balance reaches a configurable threshold
                    (default: 500,000 sats).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Automated Liquidity Management Managing liquidity on the
                Lightning Network can be complex. Blitz Wallet simplifies this
                with:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Dynamic Balancing: Automatically adjusts funds between
                    Lightning and Liquid networks based on user activity.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Swap Invoices: Automatically generates swap invoices when
                    inbound capacity is low, preventing failed payments due to
                    liquidity constraints.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div id="use-cases" class="sectionContainer">
            <h2>3. Use Cases</h2>
            <p>
              A perfect example of Blitz Wallet’s power comes from its creator,
              Blake Kaufman. During a holiday, his mother wanted to send money
              to him and his brothers for dinner. She logged onto Venmo and sent
              each of his brothers $20. However, for Blake, she used Blitz
              Wallet and sent him Bitcoin—without needing an invoice or prior
              coordination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite not being highly technical, she was able to send Bitcoin
              just as easily as using Venmo. This story highlights the
              simplicity of Blitz Wallet in onboarding new users and removing
              friction from Bitcoin transactions.
            </p>

          <div id="conclusion" class="sectionContainer">
            <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
