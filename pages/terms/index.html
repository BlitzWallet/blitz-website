          <h3>12.1 System Overview</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            The App utilizes a proprietary secure Processing System that
            operates through a sandboxed WebView Component to handle
            computationally intensive wallet operations without impacting
            application performance.
          </p>
          <h3>12.2 Seed Transmission</h3>
          <p class="mb_p"><strong>Critical Technical Disclosure: </strong></p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            To initialize your wallet, the App must perform a
            <strong> one-time, in-memory transmission</strong> of your Seed from
            your device's secure storage into the WebView Component during each
            wallet session. This transmission is necessary to enable wallet
            functionality including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sending and receiving payments</li>

          <p class="mb_p">
            We implement multiple security measures to protect the Processing
            System, including:

          <p class="mb_p"><strong>Cryptographic Protections:</strong></p>
          <ul>

              file integrity
            </li>
            <li>

          <h3>20.1 Termination by You</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Uninstalling the App from your device</li>
            <li>
              Transferring your Digital Assets to another wallet before

            </li>
            <li>Discontinuing all use of Blitz Wallet services</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Transfer all Digital Assets to another wallet</li>
            <li>Backup any important data or configuration files</li>
            <li>
              Understand that uninstalling without proper backups will result in
              permanent loss of funds
            </li>

          <h3>20.2 Termination by Us</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App
            at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Violation of these Terms</li>
            <li>Fraudulent, illegal, or harmful conduct</li>
            <li>Threats to the security or integrity of the App</li>
            <li>Court orders or legal requirements</li>
            <li>Discontinuation of the App or certain features</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>20.3 Effect of Termination</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">Upon termination:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your license to use the App immediately ends</li>
            <li>You must cease all use of the App</li>
            <li>
              Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive
              termination shall survive, including: ownership provisions,
              warranty disclaimers, indemnification, limitations of liability,
              and dispute resolution provisions
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            IMPORTANT: Because the App is self-custodial, termination does not
            affect your control over Digital Assets, provided you have properly
            secured your Wallet Credentials. However, you will no longer be able
            to access your funds through the Blitz Wallet App.

            Secure Processing System; WebView Wallet Initialization; Assumption
            of Risk
          </h2>
          <h3>System Overview</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            Blitz Wallet utilizes a proprietary secure processing architecture
            (the “Processing System”) for handling wallet and payment
            operations. This Processing System operates through a self-contained
            JavaScript bundle executed within a sandboxed WebView environment
            (“WebView Component”) to perform computationally intensive wallet
            tasks without impacting the application’s performance.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            To initialize a user’s wallet, the Blitz Wallet application must—on
            a one-time basis per wallet session—transmit the user’s
            cryptographic seed (the “Seed”), securely stored within the device’s
            operating system keychain or secure storage, into the WebView
            Component. The Seed is required to enable wallet generation,
            authentication, and transaction signing functionality.
          </p>
          <h3>Security Architecture and Safeguards</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            Blitz Wallet employs technical and organizational measures designed
            to mitigate unauthorized access or manipulation of the Processing
            System, including, without limitation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cryptographic verification of the WebView bundle hash prior to
              execution to ensure file integrity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Session-specific keypair generation and per-session random nonces
              for mutual authentication and message encryption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encrypted message passing between the native application and
              WebView Component utilizing ephemeral keys unique to each session.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replay and duplication protection through sequential event
              identifiers and timestamps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) applied to all WebView
              content to mitigate script injection and cross-site scripting
              vectors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Execution of the WebView Component in an isolated, incognito
              context with debugging, file system access, caching, and
              third-party network requests disabled.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb_p">
            These measures materially reduce the attack surface; however, the
            user acknowledges that no software or hardware system is entirely
            immune to compromise, interception, or unauthorized access.

            ASSETS:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You understand that the operation of the Processing System
              requires the controlled, one-time in-memory transfer of your Seed
              to the WebView Component.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand and accept that despite all reasonable precautions,
              there remains a residual and unavoidable risk that your Seed,
              wallet data, or transaction information could be compromised due
              to factors including, but not limited to, device-level compromise,
              operating system vulnerabilities, malicious software, or other
              external threats beyond the control of Blitz Wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are solely responsible for maintaining the physical and
              digital security of your device, including but not limited to
              enabling system security updates, passcodes, and encryption, and
              for preventing unauthorized access by third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that Blitz Wallet cannot recover your Seed or
              restore access to your wallet if your Seed is lost, corrupted, or
              compromised.
            </li>
