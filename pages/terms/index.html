            Secure Processing System; WebView Wallet Initialization; Assumption
            of Risk
          </h2>
          <h3>System Overview</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            Blitz Wallet utilizes a proprietary secure processing architecture
            (the “Processing System”) for handling wallet and payment
            operations. This Processing System operates through a self-contained
            JavaScript bundle executed within a sandboxed WebView environment
            (“WebView Component”) to perform computationally intensive wallet
            tasks without impacting the application’s performance.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            To initialize a user’s wallet, the Blitz Wallet application must—on
            a one-time basis per wallet session—transmit the user’s
            cryptographic seed (the “Seed”), securely stored within the device’s
            operating system keychain or secure storage, into the WebView
            Component. The Seed is required to enable wallet generation,
            authentication, and transaction signing functionality.
          </p>
          <h3>Security Architecture and Safeguards</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            Blitz Wallet employs technical and organizational measures designed
            to mitigate unauthorized access or manipulation of the Processing
            System, including, without limitation:

          <ul>
            <li>
              You understand that the operation of the Processing System

            <li>
              You understand and accept that despite all reasonable precautions,
              there remains a residual and unavoidable risk that your Seed,
              wallet data, or transaction information could be compromised due
              to factors including, but not limited to, device-level compromise,
              operating system vulnerabilities, malicious software, or other
              external threats beyond the control of Blitz Wallet.

            <li>
              You acknowledge that Blitz Wallet cannot recover your Seed or
              restore access to your wallet if your Seed is lost, corrupted, or
              compromised.
