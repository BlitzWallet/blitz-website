        <h2>12. WebView Processing System</h2>
        <h3>12.1 System Overview</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          The App utilizes a proprietary secure Processing System that operates
          through a sandboxed WebView Component to handle computationally
          intensive wallet operations without impacting application performance.
        </p>
        <h3>12.2 Seed Transmission</h3>
        <p class="mb_p"><strong>Critical Technical Disclosure: </strong></p>
        <p class="mb_p">
          To initialize your wallet, the App must perform a
          <strong> one-time, in-memory transmission</strong> of your Seed from
          your device's secure storage into the WebView Component during each
          wallet session. This transmission is necessary to enable wallet
          functionality including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sending and receiving payments</li>
          <li>Getting wallet balance</li>
          <li>Getting wallet transactions</li>
          <li>Other wallet actions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>12.3 Security Safeguards</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          We implement multiple security measures to protect the Processing
          System, including:
        </p>
        <p class="mb_p"><strong>Cryptographic Protections:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hash verification of the WebView bundle before execution to ensure
            file integrity
          </li>
          <li>
            Session-specific keypair generation with random nonces for mutual
            authentication
          </li>
          <li>
            Encrypted message passing using ephemeral keys unique to each
            session
          </li>
          <li>
            Replay and duplication protection through sequential identifiers and
            timestamps
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb_p"><strong>Isolation Measures:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate script
            injection and cross-site scripting
          </li>
          <li>WebView execution in an isolated, incognito context</li>
          <li>

        <p class="mb_p">
          You and Blitz Wallet agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy
          arising out of or relating to these Terms, the App, or your use of the
          App (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved through binding
          individual arbitration rather than in court, except as specified in
          Section 18.7.
        </p>

        <h3>18.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Requirement</h3>
        <p class="mb_p">
          Before initiating arbitration, you agree to first contact us to
          attempt to resolve the Dispute informally.

        <p class="mb_p"><strong>Process:</strong></p>

          cannot resolve the Dispute within 90 days, either party may initiate
          arbitration.

        </p>
        <p class="mb_p">
          This six-month period begins when you knew or reasonably should have
          known of the facts giving rise to the claim.

        <ul>
          <li>
            If the Class Action Waiver (Section 18.6) is found unenforceable,

          <h2>
            Secure Processing System; WebView Wallet Initialization; Assumption
            of Risk
          </h2>
          <h3>System Overview</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            Blitz Wallet utilizes a proprietary secure processing architecture
            (the “Processing System”) for handling wallet and payment
            operations. This Processing System operates through a self-contained
            JavaScript bundle executed within a sandboxed WebView environment
            (“WebView Component”) to perform computationally intensive wallet
            tasks without impacting the application’s performance.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            To initialize a user’s wallet, the Blitz Wallet application must—on
            a one-time basis per wallet session—transmit the user’s
            cryptographic seed (the “Seed”), securely stored within the device’s
            operating system keychain or secure storage, into the WebView
            Component. The Seed is required to enable wallet generation,
            authentication, and transaction signing functionality.
          </p>
          <h3>Security Architecture and Safeguards</h3>
          <p class="mb_p">
            Blitz Wallet employs technical and organizational measures designed
            to mitigate unauthorized access or manipulation of the Processing
            System, including, without limitation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cryptographic verification of the WebView bundle hash prior to
              execution to ensure file integrity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Session-specific keypair generation and per-session random nonces
              for mutual authentication and message encryption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encrypted message passing between the native application and
              WebView Component utilizing ephemeral keys unique to each session.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replay and duplication protection through sequential event
              identifiers and timestamps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) applied to all WebView
              content to mitigate script injection and cross-site scripting
              vectors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Execution of the WebView Component in an isolated, incognito
              context with debugging, file system access, caching, and
              third-party network requests disabled.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb_p">
            These measures materially reduce the attack surface; however, the
            user acknowledges that no software or hardware system is entirely
            immune to compromise, interception, or unauthorized access.
          </p>

              to factors including, but not limited to, device-level compromise,
              operating system vulnerabilities, malicious software, or other
              external threats beyond the control of Blitz Wallet.

            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that Blitz Wallet cannot recover your Seed or
              restore access to your wallet if your Seed is lost, corrupted, or
              compromised.
