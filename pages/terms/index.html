          <p>
            Thank you for choosing Blitz Wallet (the “App”), a self-custodial
            Bitcoin Lightning, Liquid, and Ecash wallet. By using the App, you
            agree to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”). If you do not agree
            to these Terms, you must not use the App.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Self-Custodial Nature of the App</h2>
          <p class="mb_p">
            The App is a self-custodial wallet, which means you, the user, are
            solely responsible for managing and safeguarding your private keys
            and wallet information. The App does not store, access, or manage
            any private keys, passwords, or recovery phrases on your behalf. As
            such, the following applies:
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            <strong>Full Responsibility:</strong> You are fully responsible for
            securing your wallet credentials, including but not limited to
            private keys, recovery phrases, and PIN codes.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            <strong>Transactions:</strong> All transactions made using the App
            are irreversible. If you send funds to the wrong address or lose
            access to your wallet, there is no way for the App or its developers
            to recover your funds.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Risk Acknowledgment</h2>
          <p>
            By using the App, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            <strong>Loss of Access:</strong> If you lose your private keys or
            recovery phrase, you will permanently lose access to your funds. The
            App does not provide any means of recovery.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            <strong>Cybersecurity Risks:</strong> The App is designed to be
            secure, but no software is immune to potential vulnerabilities. You
            accept the inherent risks associated with using digital wallets,
            including potential hacks, malware, and unauthorized access.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p">
            <strong>Market Risks:</strong> The value of Bitcoin and other
            cryptocurrencies is highly volatile. The developers of the App are
            not responsible for any financial losses due to changes in market
            value.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>No Liability for Losses</h2>
          <p>
            The App and its developers, contributors, and affiliates
            (collectively, “We”) are not liable for any loss, damage, or claims
            arising from:
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p bld_p">
            Errors made by the user, such as forgotten passwords, recovery
            phrases, or private keys.
          </p>
          <p class="mb_p bld_p">Transactions sent to incorrect addresses.</p>
          <p class="mb_p bld_p">Unauthorized access to the App.</p>
          <p class="mb_p bld_p">Malfunctions or bugs in the App.</p>
          <p class="mb_p bld_p">Any other use of the App.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
          <p>
            The App is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of
            any kind, either express or implied. We disclaim all warranties,
            including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a

        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall We be
            liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
            or punitive damages, including loss of funds, even if We have been
            advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation applies
            to any claim, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any
            other legal theory.

            Terms.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Open Source Nature</h2>
          <p>
            The App is open-source software. You are free to inspect, modify,
            and distribute the code in compliance with its applicable

        <div class="contentSection">
          <h2>Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
          <p>
            The App may integrate or link to third-party services, websites, or
            applications (“Third-Party Services”) to provide certain features or
